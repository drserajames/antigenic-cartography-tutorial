# Antigenic Cartography Tutorial

A brief practical introduction to antigenic cartography using the R package Racmacs, available from [github](https://github.com/acorg/Racmacs/) or [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/Racmacs/index.html). There are also a series of [additional resources](https://acorg.github.io/Racmacs/index.html) on understanding and using antigenic cartography.

The main resource is the [tutorial.Rmd](tutorial.Rmd) notebook. If you only want to use the viewer, then use [simple-tutorial.Rmd](simple-tutorial.Rmd) (this has much less functionality, but is a good place to start).

## Schedule a tutorial

I'm happy to give in-person/online tutorials if you have a group interested in learning and applying antigenic cartography; [email me](mailto:slj38@cam.ac.uk?subject=Racmacs tutorial). I will prioritise groups within my networks (Cambridge Infectious Diseases, UKHSA, GISRS, CEIRR, PROVAC).

## Problems and questions

Any problems with Racmacs, please add an [issue](https://github.com/acorg/Racmacs/issues) (ideally with a simple reproducible example of your problem)
 
If you have more general questions, please put them in the [Discussions forum](https://github.com/acorg/Racmacs/discussions)
